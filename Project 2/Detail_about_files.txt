The "API" directory contain the evaluation API, which was copied from the project directory.

The "project" directory was a copy of the root directory of my PyCharm project,
which also contain the evaluation API to enable my program to interact with.

I used Python 3.8 as interpreter.

The final test version is "1609510473.2852118"

The "Output_records_from_program.txt" file was the outputs from my program through execution.

The "Report_file_from_API.txt" file was the output file from the evaluation API.

The remaining two files contain the same thing, which is my paper report.
